# GiftCards-Sorter
Sorts all your giftcard types.

# Format of giftcards in the txt file must be:
```
Anything over here | $321 |
```
- Make sure you have `| balance here |` so the parser sorts it out.

# Usage
- Create a file named `anything.txt`
- Open a terminal head to the folder and execute this command:
 ```
 npm i readline colors line-by-line
 ```
- Run the batch file (`start.bat`) and wait a little bit.
- After it loads you should type the file name of the .txt file you made in there.
- Press enter and have fun!
